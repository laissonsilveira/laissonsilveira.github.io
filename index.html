                    to achieve my goals and improve my knowledge.

                    My professional summary: I graduated in Information Systems in 2012 from UNISUL - University of the
                    South of Santa Catarina, and since then I have worked with software development and improved with
                    courses (can be seen on my LinkedIn) and events, so I graduated and started working with development
                    at
                    a pharmacy software company (Trier Sistemas), after nearly 2 years with the company, adding
                    internship
                    and hiring, I decided to accept a bigger challenge and started working at Dígitro Tecnologia, the
                    company where I meeting today 100% remotely. I started as a Jr, and in these almost 9 years with the
                    company I have been growing personally and professionally, reaching the level of Sr developer and
                    now
                    acting as a Pl Systems Analyst,, and in the agile Scrum methodology, I also work as team leader at
                    Dígitro, Scrum Master for 7 years, still playing the role of fullstack developer, in JavaScript and
                    Java
                    languages. I also work as DevOps, managing containers (Docker) and CI such as Gitlab Runners. I also
                    maintain modules where I have to work with Shell Script and Python.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the back-end developer NodeJS for 6 years, I work daily with the language, as well as with Java
                    for
                    10 years.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On the front-end I work daily with VueJS and for many years I worked with AngularJS.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In particular projects, in addition to working with Android, Watch OS, NodeJS, HTML and JavaScript
                    in
                    extensions for the most common browsers, I also have a little experience with React.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With database I have experience with
                    Redis, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MongoDB (I have certifications for use with NodeJS and Java).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I've had a startup for 4 years (2016 - 2020), as I created and maintained along with another
                    colleague a
                    software, fully developed in JavaScript, from the front (AngularJS) to the backend (NodeJS-MongoDB)
                    hosted on AWS using EC2. In the development field, my language preference today is JavaScript
                    (NodeJS
                    and VueJS), but I really enjoy this diversity, of working with several languages, and not only
                    working
                    with development, but playing a management and DevOps role.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I also speak intermediate English and I am always practicing and constantly learning.
